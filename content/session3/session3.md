# Session 3: Package Design & Go Architecture Patterns

**Duration:** 2 hours | **Focus:** Idiomatic Go Organization, Domain-Driven Design, Avoiding Anti-Patterns

## Overview

This session focuses on organizing Go code idiomatically, designing packages around business domains rather than technical layers, and implementing comprehensive testing strategies. You'll learn to avoid common architectural anti-patterns and build maintainable Go applications.

## Key Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- [ ] Organize Go projects using domain-driven package structure
- [ ] Handle dependencies between packages properly
- [ ] Identify and resolve cyclic dependencies
- [ ] Understand why Go doesn't use traditional MVC frameworks
- [ ] Know the difference between `internal/` and `pkg/` directories
- [ ] Design small, focused interfaces
- [ ] Structure comprehensive test suites
- [ ] Implement proper mocking strategies

## Core Principles

1. **Think domains, not layers** - Package by business capability
2. **Interfaces belong with consumers** - Not with implementers
3. **Small interfaces are better** - Compose when needed
4. **Dependencies point inward** - Core domain has no external deps
5. **Avoid god packages** - Keep packages focused and cohesive
6. **Use internal/ wisely** - Hide implementation details
7. **Learn from stdlib** - Follow established Go patterns
8. **Test comprehensively** - Unit, integration, benchmarks
9. **Mock at boundaries** - Interface-based testing
