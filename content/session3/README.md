# Session 3: Package Design & Go Architecture Patterns
**Duration:** 2 hours | **Focus:** Idiomatic Go Organization, Domain-Driven Design, Avoiding Anti-Patterns

## Core Philosophy: Packages as Domain Boundaries

Go packages should represent **cohesive business domains**, not technical layers. This is fundamentally different from Java/C# patterns.

## Directory Structure

- `06-comprehensive-testing-strategy/` - Complete testing approach with 7 detailed sections
- `07-practice-problems/` - Four hands-on problems to solve

### Single Files (sections without subsections):
