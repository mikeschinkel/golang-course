# Session 2: Concurrency Foundations

**Duration:** 2 hours | **Focus:** Goroutines, Channels, Synchronization

## Overview

This session dives deep into Go's concurrency model, covering goroutines, channels, and synchronization patterns. You'll learn how to write concurrent programs that are both efficient and safe.

## Key Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- [ ] Understand the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels
- [ ] Know how to prevent goroutine leaks
- [ ] Understand when to use Mutex vs atomic operations
- [ ] Know what happens when you close a channel
- [ ] Explain the difference between concurrency and parallelism
- [ ] Handle timeouts in Go
- [ ] Understand the purpose of the select statement
- [ ] Know how to wait for multiple goroutines to complete

## Critical Concepts

- **Goroutines** are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime
- **Channels** provide communication between goroutines
- **Select** enables non-blocking channel operations
- **WaitGroup** helps coordinate goroutine completion
- **Mutex** provides mutual exclusion for shared resources
