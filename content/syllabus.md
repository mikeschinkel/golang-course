# Go Interview Preparation Course Syllabus
**Total Duration:** 8 hours across 4 sessions (2 hours each)
**Target:** Mid-level Go interview preparation
**Focus:** Hands-on coding, real interview scenarios, Go's unique features

## Course Overview
This intensive course is designed to prepare experienced developers (Java/Node.js background) for Go technical interviews. Each session combines theoretical review with practical coding challenges that mirror real interview questions.

## Session 1: Go Fundamentals & Memory Management (2 hours)
**Date:** Today, 5:00-7:00 PM EST

### Learning Objectives:
- Master Go's pointer mechanics and memory model
- Understand Go's type system and method receivers
- Handle errors idiomatically
- Write clean, Go-style code

### Topics Covered:
- Complete data types (all numeric types, strings, constants, iota)
- All data structures (arrays, slices, maps, structs)
- Pointer fundamentals and race condition pitfalls
- Value vs pointer receivers and concurrency implications
- Control structures (if, switch, for, range)
- Functions (multiple returns, closures, defer/panic/recover)
- Interface basics and type assertions
- Error handling patterns
- Memory-efficient patterns (map[T]struct{} for sets)

### Practical Exercises:
- Pointer manipulation challenges
- Method receiver selection problems
- Error handling scenarios
- Interface implementation tasks

## Session 2: Concurrency Foundations (2 hours)
**Recommended:** Monday or Tuesday

### Learning Objectives:
- Master goroutines and channel operations
- Understand Go's concurrency patterns
- Handle synchronization correctly
- Avoid common concurrency pitfalls

### Topics Covered:
- Goroutines: creation and lifecycle
- Channels: buffered vs unbuffered
- Select statements and timeouts
- sync package: Mutex, WaitGroup, atomic
- Context package for cancellation

### Practical Exercises:
- Worker pool implementations
- Producer-consumer patterns
- Timeout and cancellation scenarios
- Race condition debugging

## Session 3: Package Design & Go Architecture Patterns (2 hours)
**Recommended:** Wednesday or Thursday

### Learning Objectives:
- Master Go package design principles
- Understand domain-driven package organization
- Avoid cyclic dependencies and architectural pitfalls
- Write idiomatic Go code organization

### Topics Covered:
- Package design principles and cohesion
- Domain-driven design in Go packages (avoiding generic names)
- Avoiding cyclic dependencies
- Why MVC patterns don't work in Go
- Idiomatic Go project structure (`internal/`, `cmd/`, `pkg/`)
- Interface segregation and dependency inversion
- Comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, benchmarks)
- Mock implementations and test utilities
- HTTP handler testing patterns

### Practical Exercises:
- Refactor poorly organized code with generic package names
- Resolve cyclic dependency scenarios
- Design domain-driven package structure with specific names
- Interface design for loose coupling
- Write comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, mocks)
- HTTP handler testing and benchmarking

---

## Session 4: Standard Library Mastery & Interview Simulation (2 hours)
**Recommended:** Friday or weekend before interview

### Learning Objectives:
- Master Go standard library operations
- Use modern Go features effectively
- Handle JSON, HTTP, and file operations
- Complete full interview simulation

### Topics Covered:
- Modern Go features: embedded files (go:embed), code generation (go:generate)
- Stringer and sqlc examples for code generation
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling patterns
- HTTP client/server best practices
- File I/O and string manipulation
- Go generics and modern features (Go 1.18+)
- Testing strategies and benchmarks
- Performance optimization techniques

### Practical Exercises:
- Embedded file web server implementation
- Code generation with stringer and sqlc
- REST API implementation challenges
- Custom JSON marshaling scenarios
- Full-scale coding challenges
- Mock interview session with time pressure

## What You'll Receive:
- **Session handouts** with key concepts and exercises
- **Practice problems** for each topic area
- **Reference materials** for quick review
- **Mock interview questions** from actual Go assessments
- **Code templates** for common patterns

## Prerequisites:
- Go development environment set up
- Basic familiarity with Go syntax
- Experience with statically typed languages (Java background is perfect)

## Success Metrics:
By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
- Confidently discuss Go's memory model and pointers
- Implement concurrent solutions using goroutines and channels
- Design proper package architecture avoiding anti-patterns
- Write idiomatic Go code that follows best practices
- Handle real interview coding challenges under time pressure
- Articulate Go's advantages for backend services and microservices
- Use modern Go tooling and features

## Recommended Follow-up:
- Daily practice with Go coding challenges
- Review of company-specific technologies (GCP, K8s, gRPC)
- Practice explaining your solutions out loud
