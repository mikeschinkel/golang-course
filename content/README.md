## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Start with the [Syllabus](./syllabus.md)** to understand the complete course structure
2. **Follow sessions in order** - each builds on previous knowledge
3. **Complete practice problems** in each session
4. **Review the [Answer Key](./answer_key.md)** after attempting exercises
5. **Use session overview pages** for quick navigation and review

## ðŸ“– How to Navigate

Each session contains:
- **Session overview** (`session<n>.md`) with complete outline and navigation
- **Organized subdirectories** for major topics with detailed content
- **Individual files** for focused topics and reference materials
- **Practice problems** and interview questions
- **Homework assignments** to reinforce learning

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Objectives

By completing this course, you will be able to:

### Core Go Proficiency
- [ ] Write idiomatic Go code
- [ ] Understand Go's memory model and garbage collection
- [ ] Handle errors properly using Go conventions
- [ ] Use all Go data types and control structures effectively

### Concurrency Mastery
- [ ] Design and implement concurrent programs
- [ ] Use goroutines and channels safely
- [ ] Apply synchronization patterns correctly
- [ ] Debug and prevent race conditions

### Architecture & Design
- [ ] Organize Go projects using best practices
- [ ] Design clean interfaces and package boundaries
